User must not be able to delete a career if there is an application made with it. If there are no apps with that career, user should be able delete the career from the profile section. So if there are applications made with that career, user will need to delete each application record or change each app's career field to something else. When implementing career deletion functionality, make sure that the current career number is set to 0 each time a career is deleted.
